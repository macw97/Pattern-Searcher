# Pattern-Searcher
String searching in files/directories using multithreading and regex.
To provide proper arguments you have to insert them by the command line while compiling like that: 
```
1."C:\textDictionary\textfile.txt" "string we are looking for"
2."C:\directory" "string we are looking for"
```
